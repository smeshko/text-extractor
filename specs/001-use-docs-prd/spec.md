## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30
- Q: Number Format Specification - Which number format convention should the system support? ‚Üí A: US/UK format (period as decimal separator)
- Q: Keyword-Number Proximity Rules - How should the system determine which number is associated with a keyword? ‚Üí A: Next numeric value (first number after keyword, regardless of distance)
- Q: Personal Information Field Labeling - How are personal information fields typically presented in documents? ‚Üí A: Labeled fields with consistent labels
- Q: Password-Protected and OCR Document Scope - Should the system support password-protected PDFs and scanned PDFs requiring OCR? ‚Üí A: Neither (out of scope; reject with error messages)
- Q: Observability & Error Reporting - What level of operational visibility should the system provide? ‚Üí A: Standard (write processing log file with timestamps, warnings, and errors)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A document processor needs to quickly extract specific numerical values (associated with keywords like "HTD", "RTP") and personal identification information (names in Cyrillic/Latin scripts, ID numbers) from PDF and Word documents. The user wants to input keywords once, process a document, and receive a simple text file containing all found values with their page locations, allowing easy human review without manually searching through documents.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user has a PDF document with keyword "HTD" appearing 3 times with values 3.5, 4.2, and 7.8 on different pages, **When** user selects the file, enters "HTD" as keyword, and clicks Extract, **Then** output file shows all three HTD values with their respective page numbers

2. **Given** a user has previously searched for keywords "HTD", "RTP", and "BGN", **When** user opens the application, **Then** the keyword history list displays these three keywords for quick selection

3. **Given** a user drags a DOCX file onto the application window, **When** the file is dropped, **Then** the filename appears in the selected file display area ready for processing

4. **Given** a document contains a person's name "–ò–≤–∞–Ω –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤" (Cyrillic) and ID number starting with "1234", **When** extraction runs, **Then** output includes both name and ID first 4 digits

5. **Given** a document does not contain the keyword "XYZ" that the user searched for, **When** extraction completes, **Then** output file marks "XYZ" as "Not found" and continues processing other keywords

6. **Given** a user has selected 8 keywords and a large document, **When** extraction is running, **Then** a progress bar shows current processing status until completion

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a keyword appears in a document but no number follows it anywhere in the document? System marks that keyword occurrence as "Not found"
- What happens when a number format is ambiguous (e.g., "3,500")? System interprets using US/UK convention (3,500 = three thousand five hundred)
- What happens when personal information fields are partially present (only first name, missing ID)? System marks missing fields as "Not found" and continues
- What happens when a document has mixed Cyrillic and Latin text for the same person's name? System should extract both representations
- What happens when the same keyword appears multiple times on the same page? System extracts all occurrences with the same page number
- What happens when user selects a password-protected PDF? System detects protection and displays error message: "Password-protected PDFs are not supported"
- What happens when user selects a scanned PDF requiring OCR? System detects absence of extractable text and displays error message: "Scanned PDFs requiring OCR are not supported"
- What happens when keywords are entered with different casing (e.g., "HTD" vs "htd")? System performs case-insensitive matching

### Key Entities

- **Document**: A PDF or DOCX file submitted for processing. Must be text-based (not password-protected, not requiring OCR). Contains text content with embedded keywords, numerical values, and personal information. Has pages, and potentially line structures.

- **Keyword**: A user-defined search term (e.g., "HTD", "RTP", "BGN") used to locate numerical values in documents. Case-insensitive, can appear multiple times in a document, and is stored in history for reuse.

- **Extraction Match**: A single instance of a found keyword with its associated numerical value, including location metadata (page number, optionally line number). Multiple matches can exist for the same keyword.

- **Personal Information**: Structured identity data extracted from documents, consisting of first name, last name, and ID number prefix (first 4 digits). May contain Cyrillic, Latin, or mixed character sets.

- **Output Report**: A plain text file containing all extraction results for a single document, including document metadata, personal information, and all keyword-number matches with locations.

- **Processing Log**: A timestamped log file generated for each extraction operation, recording processing events, warnings, errors, and diagnostic information for troubleshooting purposes.

- **Keyword History**: Persistent collection of previously used keywords across sessions, allowing users to quickly reselect common search terms without re-entering them.
