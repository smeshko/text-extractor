# Feature Specification: Grid-Based Keyword History Display

**Feature Branch**: `005-i-want-the`  
**Created**: October 1, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want the history section to not show a list since it's space inefficient. I want a grid with the saved items that can be selected. I'm attaching a screenshot with a sample design idea"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Request: Replace list-based keyword history with grid layout
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actor: Users managing keyword history
   ‚Üí Action: Display history items in a space-efficient grid
   ‚Üí Data: Historical keywords from previous sessions
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must maintain selection functionality
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Grid columns/rows configuration clarified
   ‚Üí Selection behavior (single/multiple) clarified
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary: User views and selects keywords from grid display
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Must display history in grid format
   ‚Üí Must support keyword selection from grid
   ‚Üí Must be more space-efficient than current list
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Grid layout, keyword items, selection state
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Specification focuses on WHAT, not implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01

- Q: How should selected items be visually distinguished from unselected items? ‚Üí A: Not applicable (no selection state with immediate add on click behavior)
- Q: How many columns should the grid display have? ‚Üí A: Responsive flow/wrap layout (items flow left-to-right and wrap to next row based on available panel width)
- Q: Should the grid support single or multiple keyword selection? ‚Üí A: No selection state needed (immediate add on click replaces selection workflow)
- Q: Should there be visual feedback when hovering over grid items? ‚Üí A: Yes - hover state should clearly indicate items are clickable
- Q: Should the grid maintain the same height as the current listbox, or can it be taller/shorter? ‚Üí A: Dynamic height (grid grows to show all items up to a maximum height, then becomes scrollable)
- Q: What happens when there are many keywords (e.g., 50+)? ‚Üí A: Grid should be scrollable to accommodate any number of history items
- Q: Should keywords be displayed in a specific order in the grid? ‚Üí A: Most recent first (left-to-right, top-to-bottom), consistent with current list behavior
- Q: Should the "Add Selected from History" button remain, or should selection add keywords immediately? ‚Üí A: Immediate add on click (single click adds keyword directly to active list, remove "Add Selected from History" button)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the Document Data Extractor, I want to view my keyword history in a compact grid layout instead of a vertical list, so that I can see more keywords at once without scrolling and can quickly select the ones I need for extraction.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the user has keyword history containing 20 saved keywords, **When** the user views the keyword panel, **Then** the history section displays keywords in a grid format showing multiple keywords per row

2. **Given** the keyword history grid is displayed, **When** the user clicks on a keyword in the grid, **Then** the keyword is immediately added to the active keywords list and removed from the history grid

3. **Given** the keyword history contains more items than fit in the visible grid area, **When** the user scrolls within the history section, **Then** the grid scrolls to reveal additional keywords

4. **Given** the keyword history is empty, **When** the user views the keyword panel, **Then** the history section is not displayed (consistent with current behavior)

5. **Given** the user is viewing the history grid, **When** the user hovers over a keyword item, **Then** the item displays a visual hover state indicating it is interactive

6. **Given** a keyword from history is added to active keywords, **When** the user removes that keyword from active keywords, **Then** the keyword reappears in the history grid

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when the application window is resized?**
  - Grid should adapt to available width
  - Items should reflow to maintain optimal use of space
  - No horizontal scrolling should occur

- **What happens when a keyword text is very long (e.g., 80+ characters)?**
  - Grid items should handle text wrapping or truncation
  - Full keyword text should be visible through tooltip or expansion
  - Grid layout should not break or overflow

- **What happens when there is only one keyword in history?**
  - Grid should display normally with a single item
  - Layout should not look broken or awkward

- **What happens when a user adds a keyword from history and then removes it from active keywords?**
  - Keyword should immediately reappear in the history grid in its original position (most recent ordering)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display keyword history in a responsive flow/wrap layout where items flow left-to-right and wrap to next row based on available width
- **FR-002**: Grid items MUST display visual feedback on hover to indicate they are interactive
- **FR-003**: System MUST display keywords in the grid ordered by most recent first (left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
- **FR-004**: Grid MUST grow dynamically to show all items up to a maximum height, then become scrollable when items exceed that maximum
- **FR-005**: Grid items MUST automatically reflow and wrap to accommodate window resizing without horizontal scrolling
- **FR-006**: Grid MUST NOT display keywords that are already in the active keywords list
- **FR-007**: System MUST immediately add clicked keyword to active keywords list on single click (no selection state or "Add Selected" button required)
- **FR-008**: System MUST remove keywords from history grid display immediately after they are clicked and added to active keywords
- **FR-009**: System MUST remove the "Add Selected from History" button from the UI (replaced by immediate add on click behavior)
- **FR-010**: System MUST make keywords reappear in the history grid when they are removed from active keywords
- **FR-011**: System MUST hide the entire history section when keyword history is empty (consistent with current behavior)
- **FR-012**: Grid items MUST handle long keyword text without breaking the grid layout
- **FR-013**: Grid MUST NOT require horizontal scrolling regardless of window size
- **FR-014**: Grid layout MUST display more keywords in the same vertical space compared to the current list layout

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Grid Layout**: Visual arrangement of keyword history items in a responsive flow/wrap pattern that maximizes visible items while maintaining usability

- **Grid Item**: Individual keyword displayed in the grid with interactive states (normal, hover) and immediate-add behavior on click

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Space Efficiency**: Grid layout must display at least 2x more keywords in the same vertical space as the current list layout
- **Usability**: Grid items must be large enough to click comfortably (minimum touch target size for interactive elements)
- **Visual Clarity**: Hover state must be immediately distinguishable to indicate clickability
- **Performance**: Grid rendering must handle up to 1000 historical keywords without lag

## Notes

- User provided a screenshot with sample design idea showing rounded button/chip-style grid items in a flowing layout
- Current implementation uses tk.Listbox with height=4 and MULTIPLE selectmode
- Change affects keyword_panel.py lines 72-117 (history section) - replaces listbox with grid layout
- "Add Selected from History" button will be removed (lines 112-117)
- Must maintain integration with KeywordHistory model and existing callbacks
- Key behavior change: Single-click immediate add replaces select-then-add workflow (simplifies UX)
