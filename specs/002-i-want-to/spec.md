# Feature Specification: Add DOC File Format Support

**Feature Branch**: `002-i-want-to`  
**Created**: September 30, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to add doc support to the program"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Request: Add support for .doc file format (legacy Microsoft Word)
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actor: End users processing documents
   ‚Üí Action: Enable parsing of .doc files
   ‚Üí Data: Text content from .doc documents
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must integrate with existing parser architecture
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All clarified during specification review
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary: User selects .doc file and extracts keywords successfully
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Must detect .doc file type
   ‚Üí Must parse .doc and extract text
   ‚Üí Must integrate with existing extraction engine
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí DOCParser class (similar to PDFParser and DOCXParser)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Specification focuses on WHAT, not implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30

- Q: Should password-protected .doc files be supported? ‚Üí A: Not supported - Display clear error message and reject password-protected .doc files (consistent with current PDF/DOCX handling)
- Q: What specific error message should be displayed when a .doc file is corrupted or has an invalid format? ‚Üí A: Generic message - "Unable to parse document. The file may be corrupted or invalid."
- Q: What is the maximum file size limit for .doc files that the system should accept? ‚Üí A: Same as other formats - No specific limit for .doc, apply same limits as PDF/DOCX if any exist
- Q: How should page numbers be determined for .doc files, which don't have explicit page breaks like PDFs? ‚Üí A: Approximate like DOCX - Use same word-count heuristic as DOCX parser (~500 words per page)
- Q: Should .doc files be processed at the same speed as other formats, or is slower processing acceptable? ‚Üí A: Same performance - .doc processing should meet the same speed targets as PDF/DOCX (under 30 seconds for typical documents)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the Document Data Extractor, I want to process legacy Microsoft Word files (.doc format) in addition to the currently supported formats (.pdf and .docx), so that I can extract keywords and personal information from older documents without needing to convert them first.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a valid .doc file containing extractable text, **When** the user selects this file via browse or drag-and-drop, **Then** the system accepts the file and allows the user to proceed with keyword extraction

2. **Given** a .doc file has been selected and keywords have been entered, **When** the user clicks "Extract", **Then** the system successfully parses the .doc file and extracts all keyword matches with their associated numbers and approximate page locations (using word-count heuristic)

3. **Given** the user has a mix of .pdf, .docx, and .doc files, **When** the user selects a .doc file after previously selecting a .pdf, **Then** the system correctly identifies and processes the .doc file using the appropriate parser

4. **Given** a .doc file contains Cyrillic and Latin characters, **When** the system extracts text, **Then** both character sets are correctly preserved and searchable

5. **Given** the file browser is open, **When** the user views available files, **Then** .doc files are visible and selectable in the file filter along with .pdf and .docx files

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when a .doc file is corrupted or unreadable?**
  - System should display error message: "Unable to parse document. The file may be corrupted or invalid."
  - System should not crash or freeze
  - Error handling should be consistent with other document types

- **What happens when a .doc file is password-protected?**
  - System should display clear error message stating password-protected .doc files are not supported
  - System should not crash or freeze
  - Error message should be consistent with password-protected PDF handling

- **What happens when a .doc file has no extractable text (e.g., only images)?**
  - System should detect this condition
  - System should display a warning that the document contains no extractable text
  - System should handle gracefully without crashing

- **What happens when a .doc file is actually a renamed file of another format?**
  - System should attempt to validate the file format
  - System should provide error message if file is not actually a .doc file

- **What happens when a .doc file exceeds any file size limits?**
  - System should apply the same file size validation and limits as for PDF and DOCX files
  - Error handling should be consistent across all document types

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST recognize .doc file extension as a supported document type
- **FR-002**: System MUST include .doc files in the file browser filter alongside existing supported formats (.pdf, .docx)
- **FR-003**: System MUST accept .doc files via drag-and-drop functionality
- **FR-004**: System MUST parse .doc files and extract text content while preserving page structure
- **FR-005**: System MUST extract text from .doc files with the same quality and completeness as .pdf and .docx files
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve Cyrillic and Latin character sets when extracting text from .doc files
- **FR-007**: System MUST determine page numbers for .doc files using the same word-count approximation method as DOCX files (~500 words per page)
- **FR-008**: System MUST apply the same keyword extraction logic to .doc files as to other supported formats
- **FR-009**: System MUST apply the same personal information extraction logic to .doc files as to other formats
- **FR-010**: System MUST generate output files for .doc documents using the same format as for other document types
- **FR-011**: System MUST display the error message "Unable to parse document. The file may be corrupted or invalid." when a .doc file cannot be parsed due to corruption or invalid format
- **FR-012**: System MUST detect when a .doc file is password-protected and display an error message indicating password-protected .doc files are not supported
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle .doc files with no extractable text without crashing
- **FR-014**: System MUST validate that files with .doc extension are actually valid .doc format files
- **FR-015**: File type selection dialog MUST display ".doc" as part of the supported formats string (e.g., "Supported Documents (*.pdf *.docx *.doc)")
- **FR-016**: System MUST apply the same file size limits (if any) to .doc files as are applied to PDF and DOCX files
- **FR-017**: System MUST process .doc files within the same performance targets as other document formats (under 30 seconds for typical documents)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **DOC Document**: Legacy Microsoft Word binary format document (.doc) containing text, formatting, and potentially images or other embedded content. Contains extractable text content, page structure, and character encoding information.

- **Parser**: Component responsible for reading .doc files and extracting text while maintaining page boundaries and character set integrity. Must integrate with the existing parser architecture alongside PDFParser and DOCXParser.

- **Validation Result**: Output from .doc file validation indicating whether the file is readable, corrupted, password-protected, or contains no extractable text.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: .doc file processing must complete within 30 seconds for typical documents (consistent with PDF/DOCX processing targets)
- **Compatibility**: Must support legacy Microsoft Word .doc format (binary format used before Office 2007)
- **Character Encoding**: Must preserve Cyrillic and Latin character sets with same fidelity as other formats
